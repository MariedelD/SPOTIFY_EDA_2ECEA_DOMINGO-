🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥
-  ### Data Types
To better understand the dataset, identifying the data types of each column is essential for selecting the most effective Python operations. This section provides a detailed breakdown of the dataset's structure.

🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥

Using dtypes function from pandas library, this will help indicate what are the data type stored in each column.

```python
data_types = df.dtypes
print("Data Types of Each Column:\n", data_types)
```

##### Table 2.0. The Column Data Types Overview.
| **$\color{Pink}{Column\ Name}$**     | **$\color{Pink}{ Data\ Type  }$**      |   
| ------------- |:-------------:|

Table 2.0 indicates that the dataset includes two primary data types: **$\color{Pink}{int64\ for\ 17\ columns}$** containing numerical values, and **$\color{Pink}{object\ for\ 7\ columns }$** containing text or categorical information.

🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥
-  ### Non-null Counts
Recognizing missing values is key to ensuring data accuracy and minimizing potential errors. Here, a table displays the count of values present in each column.

🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥

By employing the .isnull() function, this code checks for missing values, and then the .sum() function totals all the number of missing values in each column. The outcome is stored in the variable missing_values.

```python
missing_values = df.isnull().sum()
print("\nMissing Values in Each Column:\n", missing_values)
```

This function displays the total missing values for each column.
```python
total_missing = missing_values.sum()
print(f"\nTotal Missing Values in the Dataset: {total_missing}")
```

##### Table 2.1. The Summary of Missing Values per Column.

## Basic Descriptive Statistics

🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥
- ### Stream Stats
 A statistical breakdown of stream counts, where the calculated mean, median, and standard deviation of the streams column is presented.

🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥

Given that the data type of the streams is an object, we can convert it to numeric using pd.to_numeric. This allows us to calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation using the .mean() function.

```python
mean_streams = pd.to_numeric(df['streams'], errors='coerce').mean()
median_streams = pd.to_numeric(df['streams'], errors='coerce').median()
std_streams = pd.to_numeric(df['streams'], errors='coerce').std()
```

This function displays the calculated mean, median, and standard deviation from the previous function.

```python
print("Descriptive statistics for streams")
print("Mean: ", mean_streams)
print("Median: ", median_streams)
print("Standard deviation: ", std_streams)
```
### Table 3.0. The Descriptive statistics for streams
| Metric             | Value                |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| $\mathbf{\color{Red}{Mean}}$  | 514137424.93907565      |
| $\mathbf{\color{orange}{Median}}$       | 290530915.0      |
| $\mathbf{\color{yellow}{Standard Deviation}}$ | 566856949.0388832 |

Table 3.0 shows that the average  is higher than the median, indicating that most tracks have fewer streams, but a few tracks have very high streams. On the otherhand, the standard deviation shows that the streams vary a lot between different tracks.

🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥
- ### Release Trends
This visualization offers a snapshot of the annual release trends.

🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥

If you want to design your graph and make it more appealing, you can use the following code to add colors, labels, and other design elements that will enhance the visual quality of your graph.
```python
sns.set(style="whitegrid")
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.histplot(df["released_year"], bins=5, color="darkred")
plt.xlabel("Released Year", fontsize=12)
plt.ylabel("Number of Tracks", fontsize=12)
plt.title("Distribution of Tracks Released Each Year", fontsize=14, fontweight="bold")
```

This code counts the number of tracks released each year and visualizes the data in a graph to show which year had the highest number of track releases.
```python
peak_year = df["released_year"].value_counts()
max_count = peak_year.max()
peak_year = peak_year[peak_year == max_count].index.tolist()  # List of years with peak values
plt.axvline(x=peak_year, color='violet', linestyle='--', label=f'Peak Year: {peak_year}')
```

Dsiplays visual representation of how distribution of tracks were released each year.
```python
plt.legend(title="Peak Year")
plt.show()
```
### Figure 1.0. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd059c52-aed6-4fcc-895b-bc8de95a97da)

As seen in the graph, the music industry began slowly in the 1960s, gradually picking up through the 2000s, but the peak year came in 2022, during the pandemic, when most people were staying at home.

🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥
- ### Artist Frequency
Here, illustrate a plot that reveals the extent of collaboration in the music industry, showing the number of artists per track.

🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥

Plotting a visual representation of how the number of tracks is distributed among different artists.
```python
sns.set(style="whitegrid")
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.countplot(y="artist_count", hue="artist_count", data=df, palette="Spectral", dodge=False, legend=False)
plt.ylabel("Number of Artists per Track", fontsize=12)
plt.xlabel("Number of Tracks", fontsize=12)
plt.title("Distribution of Artist Count for Each Track", fontsize=14, fontweight="bold")
plt.show()
```

### Figure 1.1. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b63d3bb1-2a0c-4e87-b1d4-3a9c7183351e)

The visual shows that the majority of released tracks were created by **$\color{violet}{solo\ artists.}$**, with fewer collaborations.

##  Top Performers

🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥
- ### Most Streamed Tracks
This section highlights the top-performing tracks, revealing the true music sensations.

🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥

Since the 'streams' column is an object data type, it is necessary to convert it to numeric in order to use the nlargest function, which will be utilized to provide the top 5 most streamed tracks.

```python
df['streams'] = pd.to_numeric(df['streams'], errors='coerce')
most_streamed_tracks = df[['track_name', 'streams']].nlargest(5, 'streams')
```

```python
print("Top 5 Most Streamed Tracks:\n", most_streamed_tracks )
```

### Table 4.0. The Top 5 Most Streamed Tracks.
| $\mathbf{\color{Red}{Rank}}$ | $\mathbf{\color{Red}{Track\ Name}}$  |  $\mathbf{\color{Red}{Streams}}$ |
| --------------------------- |:----------------------------------:| :-----------------------------:|
| 1                           | Blinding Lights                    | 3.703895e+09                   |
| 2                           | Shape of You                        | 3.562544e+09                   |
| 3                           | Someone You Loved                   | 2.887242e+09                   |
| 4                           | Dance Monkey                         | 2.864792e+09                   |
| 5                           | Sunflower - Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse | 2.808097e+09          |

The table highlights the top 5 most-streamed tracks on Spotify, revealing listener preferences, with "Blinding Lights" by The Weeknd taking the lead as the most-streamed track.

🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥
- ### Top Artists
This section highlights the top 5 artists with the most tracks in the dataset, showcasing their popularity and influence.

🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥

By using the .value_counts() function, the code counts the frequency of each artist in the 'artist(s)_name' column. Then, by applying the .head(5) function, it gets the top 5 most frequently appearing artists based on the number of tracks.

```python
top_artists = df['artist(s)_name'].value_counts().head(5)
print("\nTop 5 most Frequent Artists by Number of Tracks:\n", top_artists)
```

### Table 4.1. The Top 5 most Frequent Artists by Number of Tracks.
|$\mathbf{\color{lightblue}{Artist\ Name}}$       | $\mathbf{\color{lightblue}{Track\ Count}}$     | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Taylor Swift        |     34     | 
| The Weeknd        |    22  | 
|Bad Bunny           |    19     |  
| SZA                |    19      |  
| Harry Styles          |    17     |

Table 4.1 reveals the collaborative dynamics within the music industry, highlighting the frequency of artist pairings and group collaborations. While The Weeknd has the most-streamed track, Taylor Swift leads as the top artist with 34 collaborations, closely followed by The Weeknd with 22 collaborations.

# TEMPORAL TRENDS IN MUSIC RELEASES
#### To identify the golden era of music releases, we delved deeper into the data. By analyzing the distribution of releases across different years and months, we aim to uncover the peak years in the music industry.
---

🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥
### Tracks Released Over Time
The first stop in this section takes a deeper dive into analyzing the year that marked significant peaks in music releases, which identifies the key year that may have influenced the popularity and evolution of music over time.

🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥

Stored in the variable releases_per_year, the groupby() function groups the dataset that is in the values in the 'released_year' column. After grouping the values, using the .size() function it wil helps count the number of tracks released in each year.

```python
releases_per_year = df.groupby('released_year').size()
```

To analyze trends, the plt.figure() function is used to create a plot based on the values stored in the releases_per_year variable.

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
releases_per_year.plot(kind='area', color='pink', alpha=1)
```

Utilizing the .idxmax() function, this will find the year with the highest value in the graph.
```python
max_year = releases_per_year.idxmax() 
```
 

By using the .max() function, this will identify the highest value plotted in the graph.
```python
max_value = releases_per_year.max() 
```


This function will display the maximum values along with the corresponding year.
```python
plt.scatter(max_year, max_value, color='darkblue', s=100, zorder=5, label='Max Releases')
```

On the other hand, the following function helps the user understand the graph better by adding titles, x-labels, and y-labels.
```python
plt.title('Number of Tracks Released per Year (Max: ' + str(max_value) + ' in ' + str(max_year) + ')', fontsize=16, fontweight='bold')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Number of Tracks')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.grid(axis='y')
```

Displays the graph along with its legend.
```python
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### Figure 2.0.

🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥
### Track Released per Month
Next, we investigate the seasonal trends in music releases, identifying the months that are most popular for artists to showcase their new tracks.

🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥

Similar to the previous code, the .value_counts() function is used to count the number of tracks released per month Then, by utilizing .sort_index(), it sorts the values by their index.
```python
releases_per_month = df['released_month'].value_counts().sort_index()
```

This function improves the user's comprehension of the graph by including titles, x-axis labels, and y-axis labels.
```python
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.barplot(x=releases_per_month.index, y=releases_per_month.values, palette="rainbow")
plt.title('Number of Tracks Released per Month', fontsize=16, fontweight='bold')
plt.xlabel('Month', fontsize=14)
plt.ylabel('Number of Tracks', fontsize=14)
plt.xticks(ticks=range(0,12), labels=['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec'])
```

Displays the gathered values on the graph
```python
plt.show()
```

🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥

Stored in the correlation_with_streams variable, the .corr() function helps to find the correlation between the selected columns.
```python
correlation_with_streams = df[['streams', 'bpm', 'danceability_%', 'energy_%', 'valence_%',	'acousticness_%']].corr()
print("Correlation among Streams:\n", correlation_with_streams['streams'], "\n")
```

Aside from calculating the correlation, graphing the values aids in analyzing the relationship between them. Therefore, by using the plt function it provides visual representation of these values.
```python
plt.figure(figsize=(18, 15))
```

This graph shows the correlation between Streams and BPM.
```python
plt.subplot(2, 3, 1)
sns.regplot(x='bpm', y='streams', data=df, scatter_kws={'color': 'green'}, line_kws={'color': 'darkblue'})
plt.title('Streams vs. BPM')
```

This function illustrates the correlation between Streams and Danceability.
```python
plt.subplot(2, 3, 2)
sns.regplot(x='danceability_%', y='streams', data=df, scatter_kws={'color': 'orange'}, line_kws={'color': 'darkblue'})
plt.title('Streams vs. Danceability')
```

### The Rhythm and the Beat
#### Next, let's dive into the rhythm and beat! Calculating and plotting the correlation between Danceability and Energy to explore how these two atrributes come together and impact each other.

🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥

Similarly, the .corr() function calculates the correlation between the selected columns. Here, Correlation between Danceability and Energy.
```python
correlation_dance_energy = df['danceability_%'].corr(df['energy_%'])
print(f"Correlation between Danceability and Energy: {correlation_dance_energy:.2f}")
```

The correlation between Danceability and Energy is calculated to be  **$\color{orangered}{0.20}$** . 

To better analyze the relationships between the selected columns,by utlizing the plt function this creates visual representation of their correlations.
```python
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
```

Scatter plot for Danceability and Energy.
```python
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1) 
sns.regplot(x='danceability_%', y='energy_%', data=df, scatter_kws={'color': 'skyblue'}, line_kws={'color': 'darkblue'})
plt.title('Danceability vs Energy', fontsize=16)
plt.xlabel('Danceability (%)', fontsize=14)
plt.ylabel('Energy (%)', fontsize=14)
```

Displays the graph.
```python
plt.show()
```

Figure 3.1. 

The calculated correlation between danceability and energy shows a positive result, and the visual representation further supports this with a positive slope. This suggests that these two elements are interconnected, meaning that the more danceable a track is, the more energy it requires.

### Mood Tones
#### Beyond the rhythm and beat, the mood of the track adds an extra spice. Here, we'll explore the correlation between Valence and Acousticness to see how these elements contribute to each other.

🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥

Likewise, we can use the .corr() function to find the relation between Valence and Acousticness.
```python
correlation_valence_acousticness = df['valence_%'].corr(df['acousticness_%'])
print(f"Correlation between Valence and Acousticness: {correlation_valence_acousticness:.2f}\n")
```

The correlation between Valence and Acousticness is computed to be $\color{orangered}{-0.08}$.

To better analyze the relationships between the selected columns,by utlizing the plt function this creates visual representation of their correlations.
```python
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
sns.regplot(x='valence_%', y='acousticness_%', data=df, scatter_kws={'color': 'pink'}, line_kws={'color': 'darkred'})
plt.title('Valence vs Acousticness', fontsize=16)
plt.xlabel('Valence (%)', fontsize=14)
plt.ylabel('Acousticness (%)', fontsize=14)
plt.show()
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09b671a3-e072-4753-8ea2-8ce9957e180e)
Figure 3.2.

### The valence and acousticness of a song contribute to its overall mood. However, the calculated correlation between these two attributes reveals a negative result and slope, suggesting that they are not correlated with each other. This indicates that a track can have one of these elements without necessarily having the other.

# AUDIENCE PREFERENCES
#### As we dive further into the data, we start to uncover where tracks are making their mark across different platforms. Let’s take a closer look at the trends and see which platform the audience's preferred the most!

By utilizing the .sum() function, it sums the values of the selected columns, which helps with comparison.
```python
popular_tracks = df[['in_apple_playlists', 'in_spotify_playlists','in_spotify_charts',  'in_deezer_playlists', 'in_deezer_charts']].sum()
print("The most Popular Tracks:\n", popular_tracks)
```
### Table 6.0. The Correlation of Musical Attributes among Streams
| Track Platform           | Popularity Count |
|--------------------------|------------------|
| in_apple_playlists       | 64625.0          |
| in_spotify_playlists     | 4955719.0        |
| in_spotify_charts        | 11445.0          |
| in_deezer_playlists      | 95913.0          |
| in_deezer_charts         | 2541.0           |

Sum the values for each platform
```python
popular_tracks = df.sum()

```

Create a DataFrame for plotting
```python
platforms = pd.DataFrame({
    'Platform': popular_tracks.index,
    'Track Count': popular_tracks.values
})
```

This function adjusts the size and adds design elements to the graph.
```python
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.set(style="whitegrid")
palette = sns.color_palette(["pink", "violet", "lightgreen", "orangered", "blue"])
graph = sns.barplot(data=platforms, x='Platform', y='Track Count', palette=palette, edgecolor='black')
```

The following functions are used to add labels to the graph.
```python
plt.xlabel('Platform', fontsize=14, fontweight='bold')
plt.ylabel('Number of Tracks', fontsize=14, fontweight='bold')
plt.title('Popular Tracks Across Platforms', fontsize=16, fontweight='bold', color='darkred')
plt.grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)
```

Show the plot
```python
plt.show()
```

🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥
### Key and Mode Analysis
#### Each track has its own unique combination of key or mode. Here, we showcase which keys and modes were most commonly used by artists for their tracks.

🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥

Based on the streams data, can you identify any patterns among tracks with the same key or mode (Major vs. Minor)?
```python
streams_same_key = df.groupby(['key', 'mode'])['streams'].mean().reset_index()
print("Average Streams by Key and Mode:\n", streams_same_key, "\n")
```

## CONCLUSION
In conclusion, our exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2023 dataset provided valuable insights into what makes a song popular. We uncovered that popularity isn’t solely about the artist but is influenced by a range of musical attributes. This analysis encourages listeners to expand their musical tastes by highlighting top songs and artists. Additionally, beyond the analysis itself, this project serves as a practical guide, offering code snippets for working with specific data types and tips for creating more visually engaging graphs.
